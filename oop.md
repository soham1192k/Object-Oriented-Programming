# What is OOP?
A programming paradigm where we can represent real life entities(objects) along with their behaviour and characteristics.

# What is class?
User defined data type(contrast to builtin data types)
A blueprint for creating objects.

## Everything inside class in C++ is private by default.
### Access Modifiers:

-private: whatever is private to your class will not be accessible outside.
-public: whatever is accessible inside your class will be accessible outside as well.
-protected: whatever is protected, it is accessible to that class and all its other subclass.

# What is a constructor?
A special type of method(having same name as class name) that is invoked every time an object of a class is created.

# Default constructor
If you dont create one of your own, the compiler creates one.

# Encapsulation
Bundling/tying together data and methods operating on that data.
To prevent anything outside the class to directly access/modify our data.
## How to access encapsulated properties of a class?
Through its public methods

# Abstraction
Hiding complex things behind a procedure that makes it look simple

# Virtual Function
A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class.

# Polymorphism
Many forms
